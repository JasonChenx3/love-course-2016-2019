Hello darkness my old friend，I've come to talk with you again，Because a vision softly creeping。

Left its seeds while I was sleeping，And the vision that was planted in my brain。

Still remains within the sound of silence，In restless dreams I walked alone。

Narrow streets of cobblestone，Beef a halo of a street lamp，I turned my collar to the cold and damp。

When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light，That split the night。

And touched the sound of silence，And in the naked light I saw，Ten thousand people maybe more。

People talking without speaking，People hearing without listening，People writing songs。

That voices never shared，And no one dared，Disturb the sound of silence，Foolish and I you do not know。

Silence like a cancer goes，Hear my words and I might teach you，Take my arms and I might reach you。

But my words like silent raindrops fell，And echoed in the wells of silence，Hum…。

Within the sound of silence，詞曲:黃韻玲，編曲:黃韻玲，演唱:黃韻玲，(字幕製作:貝爾)，(黛瑪西)。
