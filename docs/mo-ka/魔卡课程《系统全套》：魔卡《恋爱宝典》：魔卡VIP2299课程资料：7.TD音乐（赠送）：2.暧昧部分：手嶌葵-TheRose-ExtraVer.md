Some say love it leaves a liver，That drowns the tender beat，Some say love it leaves a laser。

That leaves your soul to bleed，Some say love it leaves a hunger，And an interest aching need。

I say love it leaves a flower，And you its only seed，It's a heart afraid of breaking。

That never learns to dance，It's a dream afraid of waking，That never takes the chance。

It's the one who won't be taken，Who cannot seem to keep，And a soul afraid of dying。

That never learns to live，When the night has been too lonely，And the road has been too long。

And to think that love is only，For the lucky and the strong，Just remember in the winter。

For beneath the winter snow，Lies a seed that with the sun's love，In the spring becomes the rose。

Zither Harp。
