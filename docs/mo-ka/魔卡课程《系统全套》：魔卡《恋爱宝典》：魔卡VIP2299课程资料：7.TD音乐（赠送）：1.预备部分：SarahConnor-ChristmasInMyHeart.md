每當我們說再見，詞曲:陳小霞，編曲:陳小霞，演唱:陳小霞，每當我們說再見，有些東西在我心底裡在破裂，我嘗試藏起我的感情來控制自己。

But somehow I can't deny what's deep inside my soul，I've been always on the run。

So many different places having fun，But like a river always knows just where to flow。

Now that December comes I feel like coming home，It's Christmas in my heart when I'm with you。

No matter where we are，Oh what we do，Tomorrow may be grey，We may be torn apart。

But if you stay tonight，It's Christmas in my heart，Just love love love，La la la la la la。

It's Christmas in my heart，I don't know how to stay alive，Without your touch without you by my side。

Just like the deserts always waiting for the rain，Oh baby I wish the holy night would come again。

It's Christmas in my heart when I'm with you，No matter where we are，Oh what we do。

Tomorrow may be grey，We may be torn apart，But if you stay tonight，It's Christmas in my heart。

Everywhere I go，And everyone I know，Is making lots of wishes for all ten o'clock。

Oh but all I really need tonight，Is for you to come and hold me tight，What is Christmas without you。

Here by my side，I need you tonight，It's Christmas in my heart when I'm with you。

No matter where we are，Oh what we do，Tomorrow may be grey，We may be torn apart。

But if you stay tonight for Christmas，You're fulfilling all my wishes，If you stay tonight。

It's Christmas in my heart，It's Christmas in my heart，MING PAO CANADA | MING PAO TORONTO，现在安排人把这些人监禁。
