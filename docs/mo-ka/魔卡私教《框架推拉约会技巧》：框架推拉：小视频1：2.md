# 魔卡私教《框架推拉约会技巧》：框架推拉：小视频1：2

(音樂)，Good afternoon everyone，Good afternoon，We all have this one life to live。

Fleeting shadow amongst all that exist in this vast universe。

We have the ability to accomplish anything，Truly anything，If we use our time wisely，Is this jar full？

Yes，(音樂)，Is it full now？Yes，And how about now？ Is the jar full now？Yes，Yes，(笑)。

Now I want you to recognize this jar represents your life，Golf balls are the important things。

Your family， your friends， your health and your passions，The pebbles are the other important things。

Your car， your job， your home，The sand is everything else， it's just a small stuff。

Now if you put the sand in the jar first，You won't have room for the pebbles or the golf balls。

The same is true in life，If you spend all your energy and your time on the small stuff。

You won't have time for all the really important things that matter to you。

Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness，Take care of the golf balls first。

The really important things，Set your priorities，Because everything else is just sand，Yes，Professor。

 what does the beer represent？(笑)，I'm glad you asked。

It goes to show that no matter how full your life may seem to be。

There's always room for a couple of beers with a friend，(笑)，還好嗎。
