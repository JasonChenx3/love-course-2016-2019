愛的一天 詞曲:陳小霞，詞曲:陳小霞，演唱:陳小霞，編曲:陳小霞，她每天都在沙灘旁邊，在睡覺的時候吃著蜜糖，她走在沙灘上看起來超性感。

Nobody ever put a ring on her hand，Swim to the ocean shore， fish in the sea，She is the story。

 the story is she，She sings to the moon and the stars in the sky，Shining from high above。

 you shouldn't ask why，She is the one that you'll never forget，She is the heaven sent angel you met。

She must be the reason why God made a girl，She is so pretty all over the world，She plays the rhythm。

 the beat and the drum，She comes in the morning， in the evening she's gone，Every little hour。

 every second you live，Just in eternity that's what she gives，She looks like Marilyn。

 walks like Suzanne，She talks like Monica and Mary Ann，She walks in everything that you might do。

And she will respect you， forever just you，She is the one that you'll never forget。

She is the heaven sent angel you met，She must be the reason why God made a girl。

She is so pretty all over the world，She is so pretty all over the world，She is so pretty。

She is like you and me，Like them， like we，She's in you and me。

She is the one that you'll never forget，She is the heaven sent angel you met。

She must be the reason why God made a girl，She is so pretty all over the world。

She's the world that you never forget，She is the heaven sent angel you met。

She's the reason why God made a girl，She is so pretty all over the world，Na Na Na。Na Na Na。

方才他们俩还在开会呢。
