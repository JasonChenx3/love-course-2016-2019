♫anyon - missing you，Baby life was good to me，But you just made it better。

I love the way you stand by me，Through any kind of weather，I don't wanna run away。

Just wanna make your day，When you feel the world is on your shoulders，Don't wanna make it worse。

Just wanna make a smile，Baby tell me I will do whatever，It feels like nobody ever knew me。

Until you knew me，Feels like nobody ever loved me，Until you loved me。

Feels like nobody ever touched me，Until you touched me，Baby nobody nobody，Until you。

Baby it just took one hit of you，Now I'm addicted，You never know what's missing。

Till you get it then you need it，I don't wanna run away，Just wanna make your day。

When you feel the world is on your shoulders，Don't wanna make it worse，Just wanna make a smile。

Baby tell me I will do whatever，It feels like nobody ever knew me，Until you knew me。

Feels like nobody ever loved me，Until you loved me，Feels like nobody ever touched me。

Until you touched me，Baby nobody nobody，Until you，See I was enough to know，If I ever let you go。

I would be no one，Cause I never thought I'd feel，All the things you made me feel。

I wasn't looking for someone，Until you，It feels like nobody ever knew me，Until you knew me。

Feels like nobody ever loved me，Until you loved me，Feels like nobody ever touched me。

Until you touched me，Baby nobody nobody，It feels like nobody ever knew me，Until you knew me。

Feels like nobody ever loved me，Until you loved me，Feels like nobody ever touched me。

Until you touched me，Baby nobody nobody，Nobody nobody，Until you，Until you，Until you，〜 字幕由棉花糖提供〜。
