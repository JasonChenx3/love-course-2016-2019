♫ These years went by too fast ♫，♫ So can you wait before you take her？ ♫。

♫ 'Cause she's my only love ♫，♫ She's all that I have ♫，♫ It's three o'clock in the morning ♫。

♫ And he's still awake ♫，♫ And you're in there ♫，♫ Stroking her hair ♫，♫ And trying not to break ♫。

♫ The doctor says it won't be long now ♫，♫ It's been a difficult life ♫。

♫ He brings the kids in from the waiting room ♫，♫ To kiss mama one more time ♫，♫ And he tries ♫。

♫ How hard he tries ♫，♫ To accept the fact she's dying ♫，♫ But when love won't let you leave ♫。

♫ The doctor's never right， he's wrong ♫，♫ You stay the whole night by her ♫。

♫ Just waiting on a miracle to come ♫，♫ When love won't let you leave ♫。

♫ You watch her as she closes her eyes ♫，♫ Begging God please don't take her ♫。

♫ Please let me have one more night ♫，♫ With her， my wife ♫，♫ When love won't let you leave ♫。

♫ When love won't let you leave ♫，♫ When love won't let you leave ♫。

♫ When love won't let you leave ♫，(字幕製作:貝爾)，-。
