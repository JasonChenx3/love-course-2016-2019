說對不起 詞曲:陳昇，詞曲:陳昇，詞曲:陳昇，說對不起 詞曲:陳昇，詞曲:陳昇，Don't hang your head in sorrow，And please don't cry。

I know how you feel inside，I've been there before，Something's changing inside you，And don't you know。

Don't you cry，Tonight I still love you baby，Don't you cry tonight，Don't you cry tonight。

There's heaven for you baby，And don't you cry tonight，Give me a whisper，And give me a sign。

Give me a kiss before you，Tell me goodbye，Don't you take it so hard now。

And please don't take it so bad，I'll still be thinking of you，And it tells me how baby。

Don't you cry tonight，Don't you cry tonight，Don't you cry tonight，There's heaven for you baby。

And don't you cry tonight，Zither Harp，And please remember，That I never lied，And please remember。

How I felt inside，Now honey，You gotta make it your own way，But you'll be alright now sugar。

You'll feel better tomorrow，Love in the morning light，And don't you cry tonight。

Don't you cry tonight，And don't you cry tonight，There's heaven for you baby，And don't you cry。

Don't you ever cry again，Don't you cry tonight，Baby baby，Sunday，Don't you cry。

Don't you ever cry again，Don't you cry，Don't you ever cry，Zither Harp，(字幕製作/時間軸:秋月AutumnMoon)。
