# 魔卡课程《系统全套》：魔卡《恋爱宝典》：魔卡VIP2299课程资料：7.TD音乐（赠送）：1.预备部分：Ours-Dizzy

作詞:李俊傑 作曲:李俊傑，We ran， we starved the things that feel，Out back the drunken water still from me。

If we beat him down will he stay，He's a little dizzy，I feel it's starting to take me。

Where did everybody go，I need them now to save me，We fell when they choked the things that feel。

How come we hurt the ones we need，Lie down and stretch upon the sea，If we beat him down will he stay。

He's a little dizzy，I feel it's starting to take me，Where did everybody go。

I need them now to save me，If we beat him down will he stay，I need them now to save me。

Where did everybody go，I need them now to save me，I need them now to save me。

If we beat him down will he stay，He's a little dizzy，I feel it's starting to take me。

Where did everybody go，I need them now to save me，If we beat him down，Oh~，Oh~，Oh~，Oh~，Oh~，Oh~，Oh~。

Oh~，Oh~，Oh~，未经许可，不得翻唱或使用，我相信你会照顾好她的。
