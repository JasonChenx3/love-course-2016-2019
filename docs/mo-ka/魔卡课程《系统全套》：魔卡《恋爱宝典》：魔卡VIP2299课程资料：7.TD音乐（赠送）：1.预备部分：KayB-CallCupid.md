Zither Harp，Zither Harp，Ain't nothing like being alone，Coming home all alone。

Sometimes I feel like I've been all gone，The chances I've had before，Like one or two many more。

Didn't need them I've been out there all gone，If I had one chance again，Give another my last name。

This one I'll love and hold，Right until we get old，I pledge my life with vows。

Take the blame for all the rows，Yeah，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold。

I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own，All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance。

Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own。

All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own。

Somebody please hold me and give Cupid a call，I'll go to love but I need love back here in my own。

Cuz I messed up in the past and this I know，But I can sleep in the bed if it ain't warm。

If I had one chance again，Give another my last name，This one I'll love and hold。

Right until we get old，I pledge my life with vows，Take the blame for all the rows，Yeah。

Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own。

All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold。

I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own，All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance。

Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When I cook a meal，I eat all alone。

Going home from work to be on my own，When I've been with a bit，I'll be on my own，Just call C-U-P-I-E。

And tell them to send someone to me，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own。

All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold。

I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own，All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance。

Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own。

All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold。

I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own，All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance。

Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I don't wanna be alone。

I get so cold，And I get so lonely，Pick up the phone，Pick up the phone。

I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold，I'm all alone，I'm sitting here all by my own。

All that I ask is，I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，All that I ask is。

I'm giving one more chance，Cuz I ain't good at being on my own，When it's so cold。
