# PURE GAME (英语洋妞)：Texting 短信

text guidelines and dates，ok，so first of all like，talk about text first，cause that's the follow up。

that's the follow up to like，let's say get the date for you，ok，so when you initially go up。

I wanna start talking about，from the very first interaction you go up，how do you number close。

like what，what kind of criteria does it need，for you to have a solid number close。

like the interaction has to be，like she has to be like hooked，ok what does that mean though。

like she's like invested in the interaction，like she's like looking at me。

and she's like smiling as well，ok so she's actually emotionally invested。

ok she has to be somewhat emotionally invested，she has to actually feel something，right。

which means if you just go up，and have like conversation，and you're like，hey where are you from。

oh that's cool，how old are you，oh nice，hey wanna，so what's your number，does she feel anything。

nothing，there's nothing there，right，even if she gave you a number。

the chance of that number being a flake，is really really high，so to even get a solid number close。

you must，must，must，have a very solid initial interaction，and what that means is like。

you have to basically get the girl，to emotionally invest in you，ok and we talked about。

before many ways to get a girl，to emotionally invest in you，one is to be a little bit what。

polarizing，wants to be polarizing，right，wants to be very polarizing。

which is like kind of like saying，and talk about things，that are kind of like a little bit extreme。

and then come back from that，right，like back and forth，back and forth，be unpredictable，right。

be self-amused，so all those things we talked about，that generates emotion from a girl。

like you have seen me basically，you know hold a set，and get them really emotionally hooked，right。

and that's how you would，actually get a solid number，is when they're emotionally invested，now。

what's number two，ok，so they gotta be emotionally invested，what else。

spend like a lot of time with them，sometimes，sometimes，sometimes，you only have let's say two minutes。

during the day game，ok，so，that's not always the case，you're not always gonna be able。

to spend a lot of time with them，ok，so number one，is you get them emotionally invested，number two。

anything else，just be comfortable with you，to a certain degree，you have to cede，the day to。

do you understand that，you can't just talk to a girl，and then be like，hey what's your number。

I'll text you，ok，you can't like，you have to make，don't，because when you do it that way。

you make it seem like，you're getting，the whole goal of this interaction，was to get the number，right。

you make it seem like，you talking to her，like this entire like，time that you're talking to her。

is just to get a number，as if it's some fucking trophy，right，the whole point of you talking to her。

is so that you want to what，you want to see this girl again，you want to hang out with her。

so you must make some sort of plan，at least suggest something，before you even ask for the number。

that's how you，that's how you solidify it，because the number，don't put any important，on the number。

ok，so when you're going，when you want to number close，you want to be like。

so what are you doing next week，let's grab a coffee next week，downtown，3 o'clock，Tuesday。

are you free on Tuesday，what are you doing on Tuesday，oh you're busy，cool，what about Wednesday。

what are you doing on Wednesday，day after that，same time，ok，maybe you're Robinson Square，right，well。

for me personally，I'm busy during the week，would it be better for me，to ask for the next weekend。

or if it was Saturday，ask for Sunday，basically，whatever your availability is。

you ask her about that availability，do you get it，so let's say，you're only free at night time。

you're like，what are you doing on Wednesday night，what are you doing on Saturday night。

what are you doing on Tuesday night，right，you just ask that，and then be like。

yo let's meet for coffee，or let's meet for a drink，or let's go do this，because in your case。

you wouldn't，you wouldn't meet for a coffee，like fucking，10 o'clock at night，right。

so you can literally be like，hey let's go for a drink，or let's go grab a bite，Tuesday night，right。

like a late night or something，or let's go for a ride，or let's go for something，like you just。

the whole point is，you're suggesting an activity，that you're doing with her，with a specific time。

with a specific location，with what you're doing，okay，so it's like solid，right。

you're planting an actual seed，in her head，it's like，it's like a proper way，of asking a girl out。

right，and then you go for the number，and then you just go，well，okay，well what's your number。

I'll text you，right，or like you know what，like I'll，I'll call you or something，like，you know what。

I'll text you，or I'll call you or something，like，to set it up，or like to confirm。

like what's your number，then you go for the number，okay，so that's number two，you solidify it。

with a date，what's number three，so now you've got the number，what's number three。

to make it a solid number，just stay a bit longer，good，yeah，so you，you stay about like。

a minute or two afterwards，to talk even a little bit more，so that's like。

you're actually interested in her，you're not interested in like，just her fucking number。

so usually like，when I get a number close，now the only exception，is that if the girl is really。

like in a hurry，then I'll just get a number，like she'll probably run off，because she's let's say。

in a hurry to go to work，or in a hurry like to go to，an appointment she's late。

you can tell she's in a hurry，or she's going to the gym，or running home or something。

like whatever it is，you can tell she's late，then you can't stay to talk，but generally。

if the situation allows，you stay behind，at least a couple of minutes，to like talk to her。

after you get the number，you do those three things，it will fucking increase your chance of。

you know getting a call back，or something，or like a text back，or whatever，so that they're not。

going to flake，they're not going to go silent，okay，now even if you do，all three things。

let's say she still goes silent，or doesn't text you，there also could be，tons of reasons，for example。

like I've had girls，like I didn't even know this，okay，this literally from。

hundreds and hundreds and hundreds，and even thousands of girls，that I went through。

whether it's texting，or whether it's calling，or whether it's finding out from them。

or them telling me，so there could be a lot of，situations where let's say。

she just got back with her boyfriend，right，or she's going through，a tough time in life。

where she's not ready to，meet anybody for whatever，she just gave me her number。

because she gave me her number，right，I've had a girl that，texts me that，and then I've had girls。

find me out，or find out that I'm a pick up artist，and they're not interested。

they'll tell me that as well，so there could be a，million reasons，why she wouldn't want to。

text you back or whatever，but if you're getting，like in general，let's say you're getting。

like ten numbers，if they all go silent，even though you did everything，that was right。

then what the really，like the big problem is，it's not your text game，it's really your。

initial interaction，yes，I mean，okay，it's your initial interaction，you just didn't have。

a solid connection，sometimes a girl，can actually pretend，that it was an awesome time。

like for example，you probably thought，the interaction was really awesome，and then she doesn't。

fucking message you back at all，yeah，that's exactly，yeah，and then you're like，well the initial。

interaction was so good，what happened，well guess what，it was your perspective。

maybe it wasn't solid at all，right，you thought it was solid，like this，this is more of like。

like a perspective thing，like I，I see a lot of guys，go up and talk to girls，girls will like。

put on this front，where they're pretending，to be nice and polite，where the guy thinks。

it's a solid interaction，that is why，it is so important，to get them to be real with you。

just because a girl，is being nice to you，doesn't mean she likes you，it could just be fake。

could just be，she's trying to be nice，and doesn't want to reject you，give you a fucking number。

in reality，she has no intention，of meeting up with you，whatsoever，so you gotta get。

a real interaction out of them，like if，if you want，someone to be real with you，what do you gotta do。

be real with them，yeah，you gotta be real with them，like imagine，if when I first met you。

like I'm not being real at all，I'm like，oh hey，hey，I'm，I'm Jen man，nice to meet you，yeah。

so you wanna，you wanna meet girls，yeah man，like I can，I can teach you how to meet girls，dude man。

like I'm，I'm like super good at this shit，you know like，you can just tell。

I'm not being real with you，right，not only does it make you uncomfortable，you're like，oh like。

what the fuck，like you probably wouldn't be real with me either，right。

you probably wouldn't even wanna talk to me，it's the same shit，you wanna a girl to be real with you。

don't try so hard，don't try to be somebody that you are not，that's why the initial interaction。

is so so so important，right，to have like an actual interaction，where，when I say be real。

I mean literally just say what's on your mind，and like keep things real，like there's no format。

there's no formality，like you like to almost，like when you approach。

you like to set up some sort of formality，like you like to set up your approach，or like turn。

it's almost like you're turning a button on，like now you're approaching like，turn on，right。

and then when you're not approaching，like turn off，take that shit out，remember like how much。

how much better it was，when you like took out the whole game thing，just fucking be a normal dude。

be yourself，because then when they talk to you，dude they're human beings，they're not robots。

like there's no algorithm，there's no algorithm in like，getting them to hook，like。

getting girls to hook，is literally about like，the most authentic you can possibly be，and to do that。

you have to like literally，not give any fuck，about what people think about you。

like you're fully fully，putting your personality，who you are，like，on the line。

you're putting it on the fucking line，you're like this is who I am，and you go and I'm just like。

yo what's up，blah blah blah blah blah，right，it all starts from，literally the moment you approach。

with like，text，like all that texting and shit，so that's why I'm talking，about this right now。

like you walk up，literally off of the approach，if you can get them to，just be fucking real with you。

right there，you connect，right，you spike some emotions，like，every，remember what I。

remember what I told you，like you wanna，you wanna build game，on top of what，who you are，right。

so that's why，going out being authentic，is the most important thing，once you can do that。

fully being authentic，even if you're like say，stifled，like you remember，you asked me earlier。

like what if I'm，what if I'm in my head，how do I get out of my head，well，number one。

accept that you're in your head，number two，go in and just embrace。

and just show that you're in your head，and then the way you step out of that。

is literally say something，fucking stupid，that'll make yourself laugh。

that's the start of self amusement，is be able to laugh at yourself，make stupid jokes。

I'll give you an example，like when I was at the，when I get，when I took you guys to the parties。

on like campus，at university，when I took you to the parties，when I'm there with my wing，right，when I。

when I'm there with my assistant coach，like he's in there，talking to these girls。

like one of the things，I talk about that I do，is like I would tell girls，dumb，I would make up。

dumb stories about myself，or about my friends，like girls would be like，oh how did you guys meet。

craziness，right，I would make up some，dumb stories about，how I met my friend。

even though that's not true，right，or I would point at my friend，cause let's say。

he's got two girls on him，or three girls on him，and I would make up，this like dumb story or scenario。

about what's happening，right，and they get into that，like that's，that's，am I being myself，yeah。

because I'm talking about，what I want to talk about，am I，am I into it，yes，because I find it funny。

and interesting，because I find that shit hilarious，and because of those things。

they are into it as well，like they get hooked，emotionally，right，so on top of my personality。

I add in the whole game thing，right，the whole game was like，you know，amping up sexuality。

or amping up，like，their emotions，getting them to invest，making them emotionally react，right。

like hooking them hard on that，right，and then bringing them，back down a bit，to like kind of connect。

to be able to connect，so I can pump their emotions，and then bring the emotions。

down to so I can connect with them，because you can't really，connect with a girl。

if you're pumping her emotions，with like all the jokes，all the self amusement。

the only way you can connect，is like，like actual real talk，it's like，oh do you go to school here。

cool，what do you study，like oh that's very interesting，like I should do this，this this，like。

oh that must be，really awesome，blah blah blah blah，you can only connect，when the energy is not。

so fucking high，because when the emotions are high，it's all just like，super in the moment。

like it's hard，it's hard to connect，right，when they're like，when they're like super excited，or like。

their body temperature is like，through the roof，right，but that's also a good time，to escalate。

by the way，ok，so I'll talk about，escalation later，because you want to talk about，physical escalation。

but yeah，so and so，so those two，those two things I talked about，basically have a。

solid initial interaction，where you do it all with them，right，and then，so have a solid interaction。

where you could connect with them，and have a real interaction，and then you want to basically。

have them，so emotionally invest in you，and then you want to，cede the date，right。

and then you stay a little bit，after the number to talk，right，so now。

those three are the main criteria，for getting a solid fucking number，right，so it's mostly to do with。

your initial interaction，now after that，text guidelines，ok，what are you going to send for texting。

so listen to this，so in terms of texting，what I do is this，my，everything that I send。

in terms of text，I build it off of these three texts，ok，the initial first three texts。

I usually get the girl to come out，within three text messages，so the very first text message，ok。

the rule is this，your first text is always，so that she knows who this is，you could send anything。

you could say，hey nice to meet you，like，simplest thing，hey nice to meet you，- Jian，ok，or you can say。

hey this is the most important，number you ever get，store with care，- Jian，or you can say。

some sort of call back humor，right，like hey shrimp girl，it's your shrimp daddy，Jian，right。

or like say，from night game，get home safe，Jian，right，so the whole idea，of the first message。

she knows who this is，she knows who this is，she knows who's texting her，who this number is。

now your second text，so now whatever she replies，now even if she doesn't reply，ok，oh，and by the way。

the first text，you want to send it，ASAP，so within 20 minutes，an hour or two hours，ok。

don't wait for like，five six hours，like send it within that，that that that time frame，like。

around like，no no more than two hours，send it within two hours，I usually send within like。

20 minutes of meeting，ok，a lot of guys like to wait for like，three days，four days。

like that's retarded，because they meet so many guys，like a hot girl，especially like。

get approached by so many guys，probably give her number so much，even after one day，like 24 hours。

she already lost，or like forgot a lot of things，like emotions about you，like who the fuck you are。

like all that's gone，you got to hit the iron，strike while it's hot，right。

so literally after you've talked to her，had an initial interaction，20 minutes，boom，first text。

blah blah blah blah blah，name，ok，so she knows who this is，now，after this first text。

let's say she doesn't reply，or she replies，doesn't matter，regardless，within about 24 hours。

send your second text，so let，ok，so if she replies，you send your second text。

within about one or two hours，or like wait a little bit，ok，if she doesn't reply to your first text。

so it's a little bit cold，right，she's a little bit cold，you wait a day，so 24 hours。

you send your next text，so you're not needy and desperate，ok，only，only send within a few hours。

if say she's，she，like replied，ok，so your second text，is always what I call，find out availability，ok。

you always want to text with a purpose，you find out her availability，don't bullshit。

don't be a guy who sends out like，a bunch of bullshit text，for fucking no reason。

for like hours and hours and hours and days，it's a waste of time，ok，be efficient，be effective。

and just get to the point，alright，so your second text，is something along the lines，like what's your。

yeah，did you already ask，about her availability，in the initial interaction，ok，that's only if，you've。

set the exact time and date，but let's say you go，hey let's meet for coffee next week，let's say。

it's something a little bit，not like specific，you go hey what are you doing next week。

would you meet me for coffee，ok，what's your number，in that case，you gotta find out availability。

right，what if you ask for like，Saturday night，a lot of times is this，if you say，you set up it。

cause a lot of times，when I try to like，set up on the exact date，or time，they。

a lot of them would be like，you know what，I actually don't even know。

what my schedule is gonna be like，so I can't tell you，or，or，or，or，they'll be like you know what。

like let's，let's figure it out through texting，cause I can't really tell you，specifically when I'm。

off or when I'm free，cause a lot of these girls，like they work，they have full time jobs，right。

and they have other shit going on，so，it's rare that I have an interaction。

where I have it specifically set，even though I do，okay and I'll show you，like text examples of these。

okay specific text examples，on my phone，so your second text，always find out availability。

okay it's like，what's your schedule like，this week，what's your schedule like，next week，okay，or。

when are you free next week，okay you find out availability，now when you send the second text。

let's say she，now replies，so she replies to your second text with her。

if she replies with her availability，you send your third text，your third text，is always setting。

like setting it up，when where what，okay，even if she says，I am busy next week，or sorry I'm busy，or。

or even like，not giving you her availability，you can still send，the same，third text。

okay it's just to set something up，the third text，could even be，it's，it's a，it's what I call like a。

like a，like a，like a set up text，where you set up the date，or it's like a persistent text。

where you're being a little bit more persistent，okay，it's like almost universally，you could。

you could，you could send these three type of text，to like any girl，after you meet them，okay。

so your third text，is along the lines of，so for me，I send something along the lines of like，okay so。

give you two scenarios，let's say one，she's giving me her availability，so I'm free this day，this day。

this day，or she'll tell you，even if she tells you like，oh I work，say she sends me，her work schedule。

I work this day，this time，this day，this day，it's still telling me，what day she's not working。

do you understand that，so even if she tells you，like as long as she gives you。

some sort of time or date，it means that，she's interested，move forward。

you gotta make something happen，only when she goes，oh sorry I'm busy，or it's like no replies at all。

that's kind of like，more of a resistant，right，like that's more of kind of like，objection。

like kind of going cold，but if she replies to you with anything，you're good to go，okay，okay。

and on your third text，I usually just go，cool，you know based on what she said，I'll be like cool。

Tuesday night，meet me for tea，at adventure，Rob's Square，3pm，question mark，okay，I always。

I always set the time，I'm sorry，I always set the location，and date，and then I，I ask about the time。

do you get it，yeah，because you want to set the location，because it's got to do with logistics。

you want to set the date，okay，but let her，kind of like，see like what time is good for her。

so when she gives me，her availability，I kind of，almost always ask like，3pm，2pm，right，so I'll。

I'll be like，meet me for tea at adventure，in downtown，Tuesday，3pm，question mark，or 2pm，question mark。

okay，now let's say，she says to me like，oh sorry I'm busy，so second scenario，she's like oh I'm busy。

then I don't，so then my third text，is not like，it's not like，place，date，time。

it's not like that anymore，it's going to be like，okay cool，meet me for tea，downtown。

which day is good for you，you see that，you're still setting it up。

but you're being a little bit more persistent，okay and I'll show you guys，all examples of these。

do you think it's a lot，faster to meet me at like，Scott Road station，if they live downtown，yeah。

it's quite，it depends how invested，like again，it depends on your first，initial interaction，how。

how much chemistry，you guys have，like if she's really invested in you，and she really likes you。

she'll probably make her way down there，right，but let's say like，you just met，I've had it happen。

yeah，exactly，like I'm sure you've had it happen，so，if，if，like if she's not willing to go down there。

then you have to meet her somewhere else，like there's，cause girls have，when they meet you。

their investment levels，they're on different levels，in terms of how invested they are，like how。

how attracted they are to you，like how much they want to meet you，it's all different。

so you got to find out，like some girls，don't want to come all the way，downtown to meet me。

like say some girls in Richmond，they don't want to come all the way，downtown to meet me。

they're like meet me in Richmond，I'll be like okay，sure，right，I mean I，like I，I drive，so it。

it doesn't matter for me，but at least that tells me，like she's not that committed。

so when I meet up with her for the date，you know I have，some more work to do，right。

I got to basically，create more connection，or more chemistry between her and I。

but if a girl's willing to come，downtown to meet me here，I know she's invested，she's，she's very。

she's very into me，so the chance of me pulling，is really high，right，yeah，basically what this is。

it's like their compliance，right，like getting them to come on a date，and like set up the date。

and stuff like that，like where to meet，you're literally，looking at the girl's compliance level。

if she has a very high compliance level，she's very into you，the chance of me closing，is quite high。

but let's say she's not，like she's not willing to go that far，she's not willing to come to you。

then you know it's a very low，compliance level，does that make sense，yeah，I think it's pretty like。

common sense，it's like pretty standard，yeah，so okay，so with your third text。

you're setting up the date，okay，or you're being a little bit persistent，if she doesn't comply。

like which day is good for you，okay，and I sometimes，put like an email。

content like a smile or something，okay，now these three texts，the the the structure of this。

is I usually get a girl，to come out to see me，within three texts，five maximum，okay，three minimum。

five maximum，I don't send any more than five texts，I usually don't，unless it's like。

special situation，where the girl just likes，text me all this shit，back and forth，yeah。

from when you meet her，or from when you text her，say it's like Wednesday，and the date's on Saturday。

yeah，do you text her between those days，okay，yeah，very good question，so let's say you text her。

in the beginning of the week，and you're meeting on the weekend，say there's like five six days。

or whatever in between，or there might be a week in between，okay，there's a chance of her flaking。

if you don't engage her，during those days，she might even forget about the date，because for a girl。

like there's a lot of shit，going on in her life right，unless she does nothing，with her life。

sit at home and fucking play video games，like you know，like some dudes，but。

generally if you set up the date，let's say I meet a girl today，and I already set up a date tonight。

but it's for like，let's say end of the week，and I don't see her for five six days。

what am I going to do，is I'm actually，okay，so what I do personally，is I'm going to pick up the phone。

I'm going to dial her number，I'm going to call her，and talk to her，and I'm going to text her。

and talk to her on the phone，during the week，in the middle of the week，so two three days later。

I'll call her，I'll call her，just to let her hear my voice again，and over the phone。

I'll game her over the phone，and pump some emotions，crack some jokes，and I'll tell you what，calling。

is one of the most effective things，you can do，because no guys ever calls，yeah。

one time I called the girl，she was so，like almost every girl that I called，they're so blown away。

especially off tinder，you know what，you know，you know，you know，you know，what's crazy about tinder。

like I'll actually put this，in my tinder program，as well，it's like。

when I get girls numbers on tinder，I don't text them at all，I fucking call them。

I literally call them，get them on the phone，let them hear my voice，because I know that。

no guy ever calls them，no guy，every guy just text，because it's safe，exactly。

that's why I called this one girl，and she，she actually，started texting me back afterwards。

there you go，right，it's so effective，because no guy ever calls，no guy knows what to say。

like they don't even know，what the fuck to say on the phone，I find it more intimidating。

to call a girl，and just approach her in person，good，see that，because that's how。

every other guy feels，that's why nobody calls，I fucking call a girl，they're so blown away。

and I can tell，that they're blown away，and generally，I'll say something like，well。

judging by your reaction，clearly no guy ever calls you，and，there was this one girl，who's like，well。

judging by my reaction，no one ever calls me，and I was like，I'm like yeah，clearly，because no one。

like she，doesn't expect it，right，the fact that like I call，like there was one girl。

that literally saved my name，in her phone like，Jen the caller，right，yeah，and they'll literally。

meet up with me，like it's almost like，instead of the first text，like when I get Tinder numbers。

instead of texting her，I just call，talk for like 10 minutes，set up a date，right there on the phone。

okay，yeah，so like answering a question，like between a week，if you're not gonna see this girl。

fucking call her，talk to her on the phone for a bit，and when you're calling，here's what you're doing。

when I'm calling，there's almost like，I would say script，but there's kind of a structure，that I go by。

so I don't run out of things to say，or I know exactly，what I'm gonna talk about。

that's not my problem，I run out of things to say，okay，so when you call a girl。

one of my favorite lines，I'm gonna give this out to you guys，one of my favorite things to say。

when I call a girl is，hey，whatever her name is，let's say Sally，I'll be like hey Sally。

yeah I just thought about you，so I called to say hi，like how sweet is that，simple and fucking sweet。

it's like hey，I just literally thought about you，I thought I called to say hello，okay。

and then they'll be like oh hi，or like they'll be like whatever，and then they'll talk。

and I'll be like what's up，and then that's when you start talking，be like yeah I was just。

so it's almost like a cold approach，you talk about your current situation，what you were just doing。

okay so I like to say，what I was just doing，say like I was，yeah I know。

like I was just walking with my friend，or I'm like yeah I was getting a coffee。

or I was just like driving downtown，or something，and then I thought about you，blah blah blah。

and I'll be like yeah，how's it going，what did you do today，and it's like a normal conversation。

with a friend almost，and then the way to spike their emotion，is saying something that is。

how do I say it，like I like to say something，that's almost like a backhanded compliment。

okay like you know the old term like negging，right，on the phone，I would like neg her on the phone。

I would like use a backhanded compliment，to spike some emotions，so I mean I'm gonna fucking。

give this one away to you guys，here's one of the things，that I used to really like to say to a girl。

on the phone，and I think I used this so many times，was I'd call a girl，and I'd be like you know what。

I gotta be honest with you，like say for example，I'm on the phone blah blah blah，I'm like hey listen。

I gotta be really honest with you，I'm like your voice sounds a lot better，on the phone。

like I'm like your voice sounds，a lot more attractive on the phone，than in real life。

and she's like really，I'm like yeah，you should consider getting a job，as a sex operator。

or like a phone，like a phone sex operator，or something，something like，just cracking a joke。

but yeah like the point of that，ok I'm gonna be shit，ok one second，I'm gonna go put。

a little chin piece back on，so I'll say something，to kinda like spike her emotions，on the phone。

and then girls will giggle，and laugh at that shit，or I'll be like oh you，or be like you know what。

I'll be honest，like you sound a lot more，attractive in person，like your voice。

sounds more attractive in person，blah blah blah，does it have to be a long call，or，no I generally。

probably about like five minutes，sometimes I can talk to a girl，for ten minutes。

about like random shit，I'll be like oh，where do you go to school，oh cool you know what。

I actually went there before，blah blah blah blah blah，it's just like any，like I treat it like a。

initial interaction with anybody，like just care you know，and you've seen，I could talk to girls。

for hours and hours，or like doesn't matter，I could just talk about it，just come with time。

just be able to do that，yep，one's like just be comfortable，and like，also your mind，like where you're。

where you're coming from，the place you're coming from，like，I don't put them on，any sort of pedestal。

I treat them like a，normal human being，I talk to them like，a fucking human being，there's。

the fact that you can do that，do you know how many guys，out there like，every single guy。

every fucking guy，can't they can't do that，yeah that's so true，they can't do that。

they either try hard，or they like try something，like I，like I don't know，what the fuck they're doing。

like they try something，they try to be funny，or like they try to say，something impressive，right。

try to impress her，have like some sort of，cool awesome fucking story。

I just talk like a normal person，yeah，if a hot girl，like especially for hot girls。

cause they get treated so special，like，like guys treat them so special，right like。

like the fact that you treat them，like a normal person，they appreciate it。

like that kind of gives you value too，like she's like，oh he doesn't put me on a pedestal。

like this guy，must get a lot of hot girls，especially a girl thinks like。

oh he doesn't think that I'm hot，if a girl thinks that，you don't think she's hot，boom you're in。

cause that's when they seek，validation from you right，do you think she needs validation。

from a guy who already thinks she's hot，no，she already knows she hasn't，right。

that's why if you don't show like，that you're easily impressed，or like you think that。

she's like super hot，she'll start chasing validation for you，ok it's it's it's the same thing。

it starts the moment you approach，and you actually engage her，anyways，so during the week。

you will call her ok，you will call her，to kind of like keep things，you know warm right。

so she doesn't go cold，she doesn't go cold，and she forgets about you，and then。

when you actually meet up with her，for the date，right，ok when you meet up for the date。

what you're going to do，is just before，an hour beforehand or something，how do you confirm。

you don't you don't send，she and be like，hey are we still meeting up，I saw some Julian video。

I'm like I'm gonna be，50 minutes late，yeah so some shit like that，you can either say like。

you know what，I'm gonna be five minutes late，or I'm running late，or what I like to say。

like yo text me when you close，right，I always go text me，when you're close，ok or you can say。

hey I'm running，I'm running late for five minutes，or something，ok，I always like to be like。

hey let me know when you're close，or text me when you close，right，so they do that。

ok or whatever she replies，and then you meet up for the date，that's my entire text game。

like there's no text game，it's just three text，if she's not replying，you fucked up in your。

initial interaction，now do I have text game，of course I do，ok，the thing is I don't pull it out。

or use any of that shit，unless I absolutely have to，why do I need to pull out，some text game。

and like bullshit for like hours，when I could just set up a date，within like three text。

does that make sense，like who wants to do that，who wants a complication，especially when I have。

so many girls that I'm texting，I don't want to be，sending massive text messages。

to every single one of them，I just send very simple，like same format，set it all up。
